Hi, I'm Sreyaash, a computer science and statistics undergraduate student at the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign.

I love thinking about solving challenging problems, which is what got me into computer science and algorithms. I'm super interested in algorithmic trading, back-end development, and research on blockchain technologies. 

I also love skateboarding and played the piano for 12 years. If you want to get in touch, just use the social commands to get my contacts!
